I had some weird ideas of various containers for Gtk. So I'll try to implement them.

Some of ideas I would like to implement:
GtkMadCircleBox
	Widgets will be placed on a circle

GtkMadTableListBox
	Widgets will be treated little bit like words when typesetted (without word splitting :-)

GtkMadTableMinSize
	Widgets will be placed in a such wa that they will occupy minimal possible size (without conserving their original order)
